<!--Many sites also link to internal web pages like Home, About, and Contact.When making multi-page static websites, web developers often store HTML files in the root directory, or a main folder where all the files for the project are stored. As the size of the projects you create grows, you may use additional folders within the main project folder to organize your code.

project-folder/
|—— about.html
|—— contact.html
|—— index.html
The example above shows three different files — about.html, contact.html, and index.html in one folder.

HTML files are often stored in the same folder, as shown in the example above. If the browser is currently displaying index.html, it also knows that about.html and contact.html are in the same folder. Because the files are stored in the same folder, we can link web pages together using a relative path.

<a href="./contact.html">Contact</a>

In this example, the <a> tag is used with a relative path to link from the current HTML file to the contact.html file in the same folder. On the web page, Contact will appear as a link.

A relative path is a filename that shows the path to a local file 
HTML allows you to turn nearly any element into a link by wrapping that element with an anchor element. With this technique, it’s possible to turn images into links by simply wrapping the <img> element with an <a> element.
  
At this point, we have all the content we want on our page. Since we have so much content, it doesn’t all fit on the screen. How do we make it easier for a user to jump to different portions of our page?
  
When users visit our site, we want them to be able to click a link and have the page automatically scroll to a specific section.
  
In order to link to a target on the same page, we must give the target an id, like this:
  
<p id="top">This is the top of the page!</p>
<h1 id="bottom">This is the bottom! </h1>

In this example, the <p> element is assigned an id of “top” and the <h1> element is assigned “bottom.” An id can be added to most elements on a webpage.
  
An id should be descriptive to make it easier to remember the purpose of a link. The target link is a string containing the # character and the target element’s id.

As the code in an HTML file grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep track of how elements are related. Programmers use two tools to visualize the relationship between elements: whitespace and indentation.-->

        Brown bears are not always completely brown. Some can be reddish or
        yellowish. They have very large, curved claws and huge paws. Male brown
        bears are often 30% larger than female brown bears. They can range from
        5 feet to 9 feet from head to toe.
