<!--HTML files require certain elements to set up the document properly. We can let web browsers know that we are using HTML by starting our document with a document type declaration.

The declaration looks like this:
<!DOCTYPE html>

This declaration is an instruction, and it must be the first line of code in your HTML document. It tells the browser what type of document to expect, along with what version of HTML is being used in the document. For now, the browser will correctly assume that the html in <!DOCTYPE html> is referring to HTML5, as it is the current standard.

In the future, however, a new standard will override HTML5. To make sure your document is forever interpreted correctly, always include <!DOCTYPE html> at the very beginning of your HTML documents.

Lastly, HTML code is always saved in a file with an .html extension.

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration provides the browser with two pieces of information (the type of document and the HTML version to expect), but it doesn’t actually add any HTML structure or content.

To create HTML structure and content, we must add opening and closing <html> tags after declaring <!DOCTYPE html>:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

</html>
Anything between the opening <html> and closing </html> tags will be interpreted as HTML code. Without these tags, it’s possible that browsers could incorrectly interpret your HTML code.

We can  give the browser some information about the page itself by adding a <head> element.The <head> element contains the metadata for a web page. Metadata is information about the page that isn’t displayed directly on the web page. Unlike the information inside of the <body> tag, the metadata in the head is information about the page itself. You’ll see an example of this in the next exercise.
What kind of metadata about the web page can the <head> element contain?
Titles, icons, etc.

A browser’s tab displays the title specified in the <title> tag. The <title> tag is always inside of the <head>.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Brown Bears</title>

      <h2>About Brown Bears</h2>
      <p>
        The brown bear (<em>Ursus arctos</em>) is native to parts of northern
        Eurasia and North America. Its conservation status is currently
        <strong>Least Concern</strong>.<br /><br />
        There are many subspecies within the brown bear species, including the
        Atlas bear and the Himalayan brown bear.

        Brown bears are not always completely brown. Some can be reddish or
        yellowish. They have very large, curved claws and huge paws. Male brown
        bears are often 30% larger than female brown bears. They can range from
        5 feet to 9 feet from head to toe.
