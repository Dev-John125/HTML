=>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language

=>HTML is the skeleton of all web pages. HTML provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such as images, text, or videos.

=>A markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text.

=>In HTML, the computer can interpret raw text that is wrapped in HTML elements.
  HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, also known as hyperlinks.

=>HTML is composed of elements. These elements structure the webpage and define its content 

=>A tag and the content between it is called an HTML element. There are many tags that we can use to organize and display text and other types of content, like images.

1) HTML element: A unit of content in an HTML document formed by HTML tags and the text or media it contains.

2) HTML Tag: The element name, surrounded by an opening (<) and closing (>) angle bracket.

3) Opening Tag: The first HTML tag used to start an HTML element. The tag type is surrounded by opening and closing angle brackets.
 
4) Content: The information (text or other elements) contained between the opening and closing tags of an HTML element.
  
5) Closing tag: The second HTML tag used to end an HTML element. Closing tags have a forward slash (/) inside of them, directly after the left angle bracket.

   For example,this is a header element.
      <h1>Jestin John</h1>

=>HTML is organized as a collection of family tree relationships.When an element is contained inside another element, it is considered the child of that element. The child element is said to be nested inside of the parent element.
  
  For example:-
  
  <body>
   <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <div>
     <p>
      	This paragraph is a child of the div element and a grandchild of the body
      	element
     </p>
    </div>
  </body>
